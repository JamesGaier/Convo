# How To Run
use npm run start to start application

# Deployed app
To use the application https://convo0123.herokuapp.com/ you need another client to communicate with.  The app works by broadcasting messages to
All other clients.  In order for the app to work properly at least two people have to be using it at the same time.
If two people are not using the app at the same time the app technically works but does not send messages to anyone.
